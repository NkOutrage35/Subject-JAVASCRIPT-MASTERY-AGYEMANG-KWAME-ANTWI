JavaScript Fundamentals
This repository contains a series of small, interactive web projects designed to reinforce fundamental front-end development skills using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Each project focuses on a core concept of DOM manipulation, event handling, and data presentation.

Features
Student Scores Table: Dynamically generates a table from a JavaScript array of student data. It uses conditional logic to apply a "high-score" class to highlight scores of 80 or above.

Background Color Changer: A simple interactive feature that toggles the page's background and heading color between black and white with a single button click. This project demonstrates how to handle events and modify a page's style.

To-Do List App: A classic web application that allows users to add and delete tasks. It's an excellent exercise in handling user input and dynamically creating and removing HTML elements from the page.
